#MEFC

1) Concept fully designed
2)  C3(Classifier_3) not fully implemented yet, though the concept has been described in technical package, and the data bootstrapper(a very key function) works perfectly. Only issue is incompatibility between pytorch and output of bootstrapper.
3) Have to run hub.py with b2.py and c3.py in the same directory.
 Must encode 2 file paths in hub.py.
